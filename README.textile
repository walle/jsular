h1. Jsular

h2. a JavaScript regular expression editor

Jsular is a port of the awesome "Rubular":http://rubular.com made by Michael Lovitt but for javascript.

The master branch contains the prototype for now. The real application is being developed in the complete_rewrite branch.

The application has permalink support if you want to share your regex, just click the Make permalink button and share the link you get from the address bar.

You can use the application at "http://jsular.com":http://jsular.com
